## What I have learned

- **Advanced SwiftUI**: Mastered complex SwiftUI concepts including LazyVStack for performance optimization, NavigationView integration, and custom view components.
- **News API Integration**: Successfully integrated with [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch real-time news data using modern async/await patterns and proper error handling.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Structured the app using Model-View-ViewModel pattern with proper separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data models.
- **Custom Image Caching**: Implemented a sophisticated image caching system using custom `CachedAsyncImage` component for optimal performance and user experience.
- **Network Monitoring**: Integrated Network framework to monitor internet connectivity and provide real-time status updates to users.
- **Pagination & Infinite Scrolling**: Implemented efficient pagination system with automatic loading of additional content as users scroll through articles.
- **State Management**: Managed complex app state using `@ObservableObject`, `@StateObject`, and `@Published` properties for reactive UI updates.
- **JSON Decoding**: Decoded complex nested JSON responses from news APIs into Swift `Codable` structs with proper error handling and data validation.
- **Custom UI Components**: Created reusable SwiftUI components including `NewsTile` for article previews and `NetworkStatusBanner` for connectivity feedback.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Integrated haptic feedback for pull-to-refresh actions to enhance user interaction and provide tactile confirmation.
- **Date Formatting**: Implemented custom date formatting utilities to convert ISO date strings into user-friendly readable formats.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling for network failures, API responses, and image loading with graceful fallbacks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Used LazyVStack for efficient memory management when displaying large lists of news articles.
